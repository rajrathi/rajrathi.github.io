I expertise in Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures, especially in Vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc. My main priority is to make ML accessible to as many humans as possible and make even children understand the basics of ML. Though I love spending time on ML, I also work on software development to automate stuff.","author":"@rajeshwar_rathi","github":"https://github.com/rajrathi","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshwarrathi/","projects":[{"name":"Unpaired Image Translation for Brain MRI (T1 to T2 and vice-versa) using CycleGAN","description":"Developed a deep learning model for creating Brain MRI of type T1 from type T2 and vice versa using CycleGAN fused with ResNet blocks to reduce the cost, time and efforts while taking two types of MRI.","link":"https://github.com/rajrathi/image2imageBrainMRI","technology":"Python Tensorflow skimage Matplotlib NumPy"},{"name":"HuggingFace space for generating specific handwritten digits using Conditional GAN","description":"Created a HuggingFace space for generating the number of hand-written digit samples for specified digit between 0 and 9 to showcase the use of Conditional GAN.","link":"https://huggingface.co/spaces/keras-io/conditional-GAN","technology":"Python Keras Gradio HuggingFace NumPy"},{"name":"Impact Analysis Engine for Microservices","description":"Developed and deployed an utility to generate the dependency graphs for Microservices using config files and log files to reduce the latency for component automatiion.
