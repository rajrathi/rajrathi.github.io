During my undergrad, \n    I did two internships, one at VInventTech for two months and built the project for automatically detecting\n    helmets for two-wheelers. After that, I interned at Veritas under\n    Mr Hrishikesh Date, where we worked on creating an innovative solution\n    for finding dependencies between microservices.  This utility also calculated the weightage of a microservice in the system. \n    After graduation, I am working at Bitwise for multiple clients. \n    I have two years of experience in data engineering\n    for two of the clients and currently working as an ML engineer for the\n    payment technology firm, a client of Bitwise. As my interests inclined\n    toward Machine Learning, I enrolled on an online M. Sc Data Science\n    course at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, where I am currently working on my \n    Thesis (in the domain of computer vision) under the supervision of Mr Bharat Kumar Bholla.\n    ","author":"@rajeshwar_rathi","github":"https://github.com/rajrathi","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshwarrathi/","mail":"mailsforrajeshwar@gmail.com","projects":[{"name":"Unpaired Image Translation for Brain MRI (T1 to T2 and vice-versa) using CycleGAN","description":"Developed a deep learning model for creating Brain MRI of type T1 from type T2 and vice versa using CycleGAN fused with ResNet blocks to reduce the cost, time and efforts while taking two types of MRI.","link":"https://github.com/rajrathi/image2imageBrainMRI","technology":"Python Tensorflow skimage Matplotlib NumPy","id":"07"},{"name":"HuggingFace space for generating specific handwritten digits using Conditional GAN","description":"Created a HuggingFace space for generating the number of hand-written digit samples for specified digit between 0 and 9 to showcase the use of Conditional GAN.","link":"https://huggingface.co/spaces/keras-io/conditional-GAN","technology":"Python Keras Gradio HuggingFace NumPy","id":"06"},{"name":"Impact Analysis Engine for Microservices","description":"Developed and deployed an utility to generate the dependency graphs for Microservices using config files and log files to reduce the latency for component automation.
