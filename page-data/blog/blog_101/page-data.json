I expertise in Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures, especially in Vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc. My main priority is to make ML accessible to as many humans as possible and make even children understand the basics of ML. Though I love spending time on ML, I also work on software development to automate stuff.","author":"@rajeshwar_rathi","github":"https://github.com/rajrathi","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshwarrathi/"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"f900d3cd-a8c7-5fed-915d-1de7c457f3d5","excerpt":"","html":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Eigen Vectors and Values: What they do in ML?","date":"May 22, 2022","description":"A complete guide on eigen vectors and values in perspective of Machine Learning"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/blog_101/","previous":null,"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
