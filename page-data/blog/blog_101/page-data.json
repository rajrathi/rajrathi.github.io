During my undergrad, \n    I did two internships, one at VInventTech for two months and built the project for automatically detecting\n    helmets for two-wheelers. After that, I interned at Veritas under\n    Mr Hrishikesh Date, where we worked on creating an innovative solution\n    for finding dependencies between microservices.  This utility also calculated the weightage of a microservice in the system. \n    After graduation, I am working at Bitwise for multiple clients. \n    I have two years of experience in data engineering\n    for two of the clients and currently working as an ML engineer for the\n    payment technology firm, a client of Bitwise. As my interests inclined\n    toward Machine Learning, I completed on an online PG Diploma course in Data Science at IIIT, Bangalore.\n    ","author":"@rajeshwar_rathi","github":"https://github.com/rajrathi","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshwarrathi/","mail":"mailsforrajeshwar@gmail.com"}},"mdx":{"id":"74779f99-c900-58ec-9e2c-19a633b707bb","excerpt":"","body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign ?
