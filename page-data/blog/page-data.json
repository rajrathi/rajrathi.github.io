I expertise in Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures, especially in Vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc. My main priority is to make ML accessible to as many humans as possible and make even children understand the basics of ML. Though I love spending time on ML, I also work on software development to automate stuff.","author":"@rajeshwar_rathi","github":"https://github.com/rajrathi","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshwarrathi/","medium":"https://medium.com/@rajeshwar.r.rathi"}},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/blog/blog_101/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 22, 2022","title":"CycleGAN: cycle-consistency is the key","description":"Lets understand CycleGAN with a discussion and practice"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
