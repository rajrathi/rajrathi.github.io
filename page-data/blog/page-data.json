During my undergrad, \n    I did two internships, one at VInventTech for two months and built the project for automatically detecting\n    helmets for two-wheelers. After that, I interned at Veritas under\n    Mr Hrishikesh Date, where we worked on creating an innovative solution\n    for finding dependencies between microservices.  This utility also calculated the weightage of a microservice in the system. \n    After graduation, I am working at Bitwise for multiple clients. \n    I have two years of experience in data engineering\n    for two of the clients and currently working as an ML engineer for the\n    payment technology firm, a client of Bitwise. As my interests inclined\n    toward Machine Learning, I completed on an online PG Diploma course in Data Science at IIIT, Bangalore.\n    ","author":"@rajeshwar_rathi","github":"https://github.com/rajrathi","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshwarrathi/","mail":"mailsforrajeshwar@gmail.com"}},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/blog/blog_101/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 22, 2022","description":"Lets understand CycleGAN with a discussion and practice","title":"CycleGAN: cycle-consistency is the key","thumb":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dc97ececb2a24bffadf7d4adfd514ca9/8727f/cyclegan.webp","srcSet":"/static/dc97ececb2a24bffadf7d4adfd514ca9/0993c/cyclegan.webp 159w,\n/static/dc97ececb2a24bffadf7d4adfd514ca9/537c6/cyclegan.webp 318w,\n/static/dc97ececb2a24bffadf7d4adfd514ca9/8727f/cyclegan.webp 635w","sizes":"(min-width: 635px) 635px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":635,"height":634}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["4119628462","63159454"]}
